# Personal Arch Linux Config

## Prerequisites

- emacs

## Tangle Configs

Where possible, emacs and org-tangle are used to allow for config files to be augmented with rich comments. A `.org` file will be present which is the rich content. This can be tangled to generate the configuration file which is also committed to allow easy comparison between versions.
